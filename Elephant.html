     <h3>Meet the Elephant – Gentle Giants of the Wild</h3>
     <P>The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth, admired for its strength, intelligence, and deep emotional connections. African elephants can stand up to 4 meters (13 feet) tall and weigh over 6,000 kilograms (13,000 pounds), while Asian elephants are slightly smaller. Their iconic trunks are incredibly versatile—used for breathing, feeding, drinking, and even expressing affection. Elephants also have long ivory tusks, which they use to dig, strip bark, and defend themselves.
<br>
<br>
But elephants aren’t just massive—they’re also highly intelligent and social. They live in matriarchal family herds, led by the oldest female, and they show deep emotions like joy, grief, and compassion. Elephants are known to mourn their dead, recognize themselves in mirrors, and use low-frequency rumbles to communicate across long distances. Despite their majestic presence, elephants face serious threats from poaching and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are critical to ensuring these magnificent creatures continue to roam the wild.
