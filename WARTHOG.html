     <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
     <P><strong>  Meet the Warthog – Tough, Fast, and Surprisingly Smart</strong></P>
<p>The warthog may not win a beauty contest, but it’s one of the most fascinating animals in the savannah! With its flat face, curved tusks, and wiry mane, the warthog looks like a little tank—and behaves like one too. These tough herbivores use their tusks to dig, defend themselves, and fight for territory. Despite their bulky appearance, warthogs can run up to 48 km/h (30 mph) when threatened.

Warthogs are also clever survivors. They often kneel on their front legs to graze and will back into burrows for protection—tusks out, ready to fight. They live in groups called sounders, and you’ll often spot them with tails sticking straight up as they run! Adaptable, resilient, and full of character, warthogs are a true example of brains and brawn in the African wild.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
