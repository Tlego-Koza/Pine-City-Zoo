     <h3>MONKEY</h3>
     <P><strong>Meet the Monkey – Playful, Clever, and Full of Energy</strong></P>
<p>Monkeys are curious, intelligent, and full of personality. Found in forests, jungles, and even cities across the world, they are incredibly diverse—with over 260 different species, ranging from tiny pygmy marmosets to large baboons. Monkeys are social animals that live in troops and communicate through a mix of vocal sounds, facial expressions, and gestures. Many species use tools, solve puzzles, and learn by observation—making them one of the smartest animal groups on Earth.

Their agility and energy are unmatched—they swing, leap, and climb with ease using their long limbs and prehensile tails (in some species). Monkeys are not only fun to watch but also play an important role in forest ecosystems by spreading seeds and maintaining plant diversity. Unfortunately, many monkey species face threats from deforestation and illegal wildlife trade. Conservation helps protect both these animals and the habitats they call home.</p>
