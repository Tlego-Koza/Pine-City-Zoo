     <h3>LION</h3>
     <P><strong>Meet the Lion – King of the Jungle</strong></P>
<p>The lion is one of the most iconic animals in the world, often referred to as the "King of the Jungle"—though they actually live in open savannahs and grasslands. Male lions are known for their majestic manes, while females, called lionesses, are the primary hunters in the pride. Lions live in social groups called prides, which can include up to 30 members. A fully grown male lion can weigh over 190 kg (420 pounds) and can roar so loudly it’s heard up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) away!

Lions are powerful predators, but they also spend much of their time resting—up to 20 hours a day! Their strength, teamwork, and fearsome presence make them fascinating animals to observe. Sadly, wild lion populations are declining due to habitat loss and conflict with humans. Protecting them ensures that future generations can still witness the awe of this royal species in its natural habitat.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
