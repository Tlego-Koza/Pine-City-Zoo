     <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
     <P><strong> Meet the Rhino Beetle – Nature’s Tiny Powerlifter</strong></P>
<p>Don’t let its size fool you—the rhino beetle is one of the strongest creatures on Earth for its weight! Named for the horn-like structure on its head (which resembles a rhinoceros), this beetle can lift objects up to 850 times its own body weight. That’s like a human lifting a large truck! Rhino beetles use their horns in battles with rivals during mating season, locking horns and wrestling for dominance.

These fascinating insects are completely harmless to humans and play an important role in nature. They help decompose dead plants, recycling nutrients back into the soil. Found in forests around the world, rhino beetles are a favorite among bug lovers for their armored appearance and incredible strength. They may be small, but they are true giants of the insect world.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
