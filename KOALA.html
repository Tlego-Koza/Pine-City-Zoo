     <h3>KOALA</h3>
     <P><strong>Meet the Koala – Sleepy Icons of the Aussie Bush</strong></P>
<p>The koala is one of Australia’s most beloved animals, known for its fluffy ears, spoon-shaped nose, and calm, sleepy demeanor. Though often called a "koala bear," it's not a bear at all—koalas are marsupials, meaning they carry their young in a pouch. These tree-dwelling creatures spend up to 20 hours a day sleeping to conserve energy, as their diet consists mainly of eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and difficult to digest.
<br>
<br>
Koalas are perfectly adapted for life in the treetops. They have strong limbs, sharp claws for gripping bark, and a thick, soft coat to protect against wind and rain. Each koala has a unique nose pattern, like a fingerprint! Sadly, their numbers are declining due to habitat destruction, bushfires, and disease. Conservation efforts are now more important than ever to ensure that these peaceful, iconic animals remain part of Australia's natural heritage.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
