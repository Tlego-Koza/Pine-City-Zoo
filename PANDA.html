     <h3>PANDA</h3>
     <P><strong>Meet the Panda – Nature’s Black-and-White Treasure</strong></P>
<p>The giant panda is one of the world’s most beloved animals, instantly recognized by its fluffy black-and-white coat and gentle nature. Native to the mountainous bamboo forests of China, pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating, mainly consuming bamboo. Despite their bear-like appearance, pandas are mostly solitary and peaceful creatures that communicate using sounds, scents, and body language.

Adult pandas can weigh up to 135 kg (300 pounds) and have an extra thumb-like bone in their paws to help grip bamboo stalks. Pandas once faced extinction, but thanks to global conservation efforts and habitat protection, their population is slowly recovering. Still, they remain a symbol of wildlife conservation—reminding us of the delicate balance between nature and human activity.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
