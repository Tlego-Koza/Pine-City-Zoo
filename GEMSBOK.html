     <h3>GMeet the Gemsbok – Desert Masters of Survival</h3>
  
<p>The gemsbok, also known as the oryx, is a majestic antelope perfectly built for life in the desert. Native to arid regions like the Kalahari Desert, these remarkable animals thrive in extreme heat and dry conditions.</p> 
<p>They rarely need to drink water, instead getting moisture from wild melons, roots, and desert grasses. With their sleek grey coats and bold black-and-white markings, gemsbok blend beautifully into the desert landscape.</p>

<p>But what truly makes the gemsbok stand out are their long, straight horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33 inches).</p> 
<p>Both males and females use these horns for defense—and they’re sharp enough to deter even predators like lions! Gemsbok also have a natural “cooling system” that protects their brain from overheating, allowing them to stay active under the blazing sun. Graceful, tough, and fiercely independent, the gemsbok is one of nature’s finest survival experts.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
