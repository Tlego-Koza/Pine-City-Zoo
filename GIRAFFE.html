     <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
     <P><strong>Meet the Giraffe – The Tallest Animal on Earth</strong></P>
<p>The giraffe is one of the most iconic and beloved animals in the wild, instantly recognizable by its towering height, long neck, and unique spotted coat. Giraffes can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall, with males often being taller than females. Their long necks allow them to reach the highest branches of trees—especially acacia trees—which few other animals can access. Despite their long necks, giraffes still have only seven neck vertebrae, just like humans!

Giraffes are gentle and social, often seen in loose herds roaming the savannah. They use their 45 cm (18-inch) tongues to strip leaves from thorny branches with incredible precision. Though calm by nature, giraffes can defend themselves with powerful kicks strong enough to injure or kill a predator. With their graceful walk and peaceful presence, giraffes truly embody the quiet majesty of the African wild.</p>
