     <h3>TIGER</h3>
     <P><strong> Meet the Rhino Beetle – Nature’s Tiny Powerlifter</strong></P>
<p>The tiger is the largest member of the cat family and one of the most awe-inspiring predators in the wild. With its bold black stripes, powerful build, and fiery orange coat, the tiger is built for both beauty and stealth. Tigers can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lbs) and leap over 6 meters (20 feet) in a single bound. They are expert hunters who rely on silence and surprise, often stalking prey before launching a powerful attack.

Tigers are solitary by nature, patrolling vast territories alone. Each stripe pattern is as unique as a fingerprint, helping them blend perfectly into tall grasses and forests. Sadly, all tiger subspecies are under threat from habitat loss and poaching. As top predators, they play a crucial role in balancing ecosystems. Protecting tigers means protecting the wild itself.</p>

    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
    <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
