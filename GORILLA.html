     <h3>GORILLA</h3>
     <P><strong>Meet the Gorilla – Mighty, Intelligent, and Gentle</strong></P>
<p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth, known for their incredible strength, expressive faces, and surprisingly gentle nature. Native to the forests of Central and East Africa, gorillas live in close-knit family groups led by a dominant male called a silverback—named for the distinctive silver hair on his back. While they can weigh up to 180 kg (400 pounds) and stand nearly 1.8 meters (6 feet) tall when upright, gorillas are calm, peaceful herbivores that spend most of their day foraging for fruits, leaves, and stems.

Despite their powerful build, gorillas are deeply social and intelligent. They communicate through body language, facial expressions, vocal sounds, and even laughter. Some have been taught to use sign language in captivity! Sadly, gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat destruction, disease, and poaching. Protecting them means preserving not just a species, but one of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom—sharing nearly 98% of our DNA.</p>
